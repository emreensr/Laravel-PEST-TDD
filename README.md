# LARAVEL TDD EXAMPLE USÄ°NG PEST PHP

Using the test-driven approach, I built a simple CRUD application that allows you to create, edit, update and delete tasks.

- Only authenticated user can visit the posts routes
- Validation when we store a new post.
- Test post create form.
- Test post index page.
- Test post update page.
- Only users who own the blog post can delete it.
